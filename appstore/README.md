# TouchGUI app store

This repository contains apps for the TouchGUI. The store app uses
this as a default to download apps.

App development tutorials can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/ftCommunity/ftcommunity-TXT/wiki) of the [ftcommunity-TXT](https://github.com/ftCommunity).

These tutorials use the ```Txt``` prefix for all function and class names as they were written for the Fischertechnik TXT. The TouchUI uses ```Touch``` instead. So e.g. if the tutorials mention the class ```TxtApplication``` you'll have to use ```TouchApplication``` instead.
